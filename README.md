#Introduction
Welcome to the WAN IP Project README! Our project aims to assist users of Ethio Telecom in setting up their Wi-Fi router modems by providing their WAN IP information. This README will guide you through the project's purpose, installation process, usage, and more.

#Deployed Site: WAN IP Project

#Author's LinkedIn: Yohanes Senbeto
Installation
#To get started with the WAN IP Project, follow these steps:

#Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/YohanesSenbeto/WAN-IP-Project.git
#Navigate to the project directory: cd WAN-IP-Project
#Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:
#For frontend (React.js): cd frontend && npm install
#For backend (Node.js): cd backend && npm install
#Set up the database using XAMPP or another suitable database management system.
#Configure the backend to connect to your database by updating the database configuration file.
#Run the frontend and backend servers:
#For frontend: cd frontend && npm start
#For backend: cd backend && node app.js
#Usage
Once the project is set up and running, users can visit the deployed site to access the WAN IP information for their Wi-Fi router modems. They can enter their router model and view the corresponding WAN IP address.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.     

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your 
project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
